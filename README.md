## Summary of Assignment

<p align="justify">This repository contains my programming for data alaysis assignmnet 2019. It looks at the numpy.random package in python.  It will briefly introduce the overall purpose of the package and explain the use of the simple random data an permutaion functions.  It explains the use and purpose of five distribution functions the 1. ,2.,3., 3., 5., and finally it explains the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers. My note book contains explations for each of the  ? lines of input code with ? lines of out put code, 


I commenced work on this assignment around the 10th of October 2019 and completed work on   November 2019.

## Libaries used in this Assignment
I Imported: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

numpy

*???? Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

* Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

* ????Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

## Running the Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):

jupyter notebook
This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.

When started, the Jupyter Notebook App can access only files within its start-up folder (including any sub-folder). No configuration is necessary if you place your notebooks in your home folder or subfolders. Otherwise, you need to choose a Jupyter Notebook App start-up folder which will contain all the notebooks.


Download the notebook you want to execute and put it in your notebook folder (or a sub-folder of it).

Then follow these steps:

Launch the Jupyter Notebook App (see previous section).
In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab.
Click on the menu Help -> User Interface Tour for an overview of the Jupyter Notebook App user interface.
You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter.
You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etcâ€¦).
