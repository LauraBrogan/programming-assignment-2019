## Summary of Assignment

<p align="justify">This repository contains my programming for data alaysis assignmnet 2019. It looks at the numpy.random package in python.  It will briefly introduce the overall purpose of the package and explain the use of the simple random data an permutaion functions.  It explains the use and purpose of five distribution functions the 1. ,2.,3., 3., 5., and finally it explains the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers. My note book contains explations for each of the  ? lines of input code with ? lines of out put code, 


I commenced work on this assignment around the 10th of October 2019 and completed work on   November 2019.
