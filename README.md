# Assignment for Programming for Data Analysis 2019
 
<p align="justify">This repository contains my programming for data alaysis assignmnet 2019. It looks at the numpy.random package in python.  It will briefly introduces the overall purpose of the package and explain the use of the simple random data an permutaion functions.  It explains the use and purpose of five distribution functions the 1. ,2.,3., 3., 5., and finally it explaina the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

I commenced work on this assignment around the 10th of October 2019 and completed work on   November 2019.  </p>
